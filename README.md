## üéØ Core Concepts

### Privacy-First User Profiling

This application revolutionizes user analytics by implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** directly in smart contracts. Unlike traditional analytics platforms that require raw data access, our solution enables:

- **Encrypted Data Processing**: All user profile data is encrypted before storage on the blockchain
- **Confidential Analytics**: Perform calculations and comparisons on encrypted data without decryption
- **Zero-Knowledge Insights**: Generate meaningful analytics while maintaining complete data privacy
- **Decentralized Trust**: No central authority has access to unencrypted user information

### FHE Smart Contract Architecture

Our smart contract leverages the **Zama FHE** protocol to create truly private user profiles:

#### üîí Encrypted User Profile Structure
```solidity
struct UserProfile {
    euint8 ageRange;          // 0-7 representing age ranges
    euint8 incomeLevel;       // 0-9 representing income brackets
    euint8 spendingPattern;   // 0-9 representing spending habits
    euint8 riskTolerance;     // 0-9 representing risk tolerance
    euint8 digitalActivity;   // 0-9 representing digital engagement
    euint8 locationCluster;   // 0-19 representing geographic clusters
}
```
